## osdata

This folder is where the Ordinance Survey zip should be extracted.
This should create two new folders:

# DATA/

This folder contains the ~800 CSV files with the placename data. All
the files have the same structure and have names similar to NZ26.csv.

# DOC/

Contains licencing information and a single CSV header file that
applies to each of the DATA files.
